I am a PhD student at IIT Delhi, fortunate to be advised by Dr. Mausam (IIT Delhi) and Dr. Soumen Chakrabarti (IIT Bombay). I work in the broad area of NLP, with a particular focus on problems relating to Neural Open Information Extraction, improving pre-trained language models (like BERT) and probing NLP architectures

I did my BTech at IIT Bhubaneswar where I explored a wide-range of topics, with research projects in Deep Learning (under Prof. Chitta Baral,
Arizona State University), Synchronous Programs (Prof. Partha Roop, University of Auckland), and Sofware Engineering (with
Dr. Manoranjan Satpathy, IIT Bhubaneswar)

I previously interned at IBM Research (Summer, 2017) and Microsoft Bing (Summer, 2016)

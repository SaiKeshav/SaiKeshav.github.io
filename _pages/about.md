I am a PhD student at IIT Delhi, being advised by Dr. Mausam (IIT Delhi) and Dr. Soumen Chakrabarti (IIT Bombay),
working in the broad area of NLP. I particularly focus on problems relating to Neural Open Information Extraction,
Probing NLP Architectures, and improving pre-trained language models, like BERT.

I got my BTech degree from IIT Bhubaneswar where I explored projects in Computer Vision (with Prof. Chitta Baral,
Arizona State University), Synchronous Programs (Prof. Partha Roop, University of Auckland), and Sofware Engineering (with
Dr. Manoranjan Satpathy, IIT Bhubaneswar)

I have previously interned at IBM Research (Summer, 2017) and Microsoft Bing (Summer, 2016)

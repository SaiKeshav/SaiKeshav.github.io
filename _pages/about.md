I am Keshav, a PhD candidate at Indian Insitute of Technology (IIT), Delhi. 
I work in the broad area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning.
I am fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. Mausam (HoD, School of AI, IIT Delhi) and Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti (IIT Bombay). 
In my PhD research, I have focussed on building the next generation Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) systems which is the leading technique for constructing large-scale KBs across a vareity of domains, ranging from finance to medicine. 
I am also excited about adapting and building NLP technology for Indian languages.

I had the chance to work as a Visiting Student Researcher at Google Research (Spring, 2020), Reserach Intern at IBM Research (Summer, 2017) and Data Science intern at Microsoft Bing (Summer, 2016).

During my BTech at IIT Bhubaneswar, I had the chance to work with Prof Chitta Baral (Arizona State University), Prof Partha Roop (University of Auckland) and Prof Manoranjan (IIT Bhubhaneswar) on a wide variety of interesting research problems in Computer Vision, Synchornous Programs and Software Testing.

I am a PhD student at IIT Delhi, being advised by Dr. Mausam (IIT Delhi) and Dr. Soumen Chakrabarti (IIT Bombay),
working in the broad area of NLP. I particularly focus on problems relating to Neural Open Information Extraction,
Probing NLP Architectures, and improving pre-trained language models, like BERT.
